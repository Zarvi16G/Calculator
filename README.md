# Calculator

My project is a basic calculator implemented in Python. This calculator can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Using Python, I have created a simple user interface that allows the user to input two numbers and select the operation they want to perform. The calculator then displays the result of the operation on the screen. This project is an excellent introduction to programming in Python and demonstrates how basic mathematical tasks can be performed using this versatile and powerful programming language.

Usage
1.Clone or download the repository.
2.Open the main.py file in Visual Studio Code.
3.Run the program from the terminal.
